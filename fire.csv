Forest Fire Danger Index,"There are a number of options that will be explored.

1. Black Summer-like scenario: cumulative FFDI (D, DJ, SONDJF)

2. Daily extreme fire weatehr conditions (e.g., Black Saturday like scenario) - considering daily values of FFDI.

3. Changes in 'dangerous fire days': 'dangerous' fire days are defined as days when the FFDI exceeds the 90% percentile calculated over the climatology period (1990-2019). This is adapting the fire weather results shown in the State of the Climate report. 

",Avg threshold for fire event,Likelihood of exceedence for fire event threshold,Likelihood and frequency of exceedence for fire event threshold,"1. Produce a 'seemless' timeseries of seasonal cumulative FFDI for the study region (e.g., Bega LGA) spanning the historical/obs into the ensemble of regional climate projections.

2. Explore possibility of producing maps showing the 'change in number of dangerous fire days' between the period 1990-2019 and the two future periods.
